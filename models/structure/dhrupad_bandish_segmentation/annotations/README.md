# Annotations

Please, download the annotations from the original repo: https://github.com/DAP-Lab/dhrupad-bandish-segmentation. Then, store in this folder the following
contents:

## Contents
* [section_boundaries_labels.csv](section_boundaries_labels.csv) - list of the sections in each audio, their start and end timestamps (in seconds) and their labels (vocal s.t.m., pakhawaj s.t.m., net s.t.m.)
* [cycle_boundaries/](cycle_boundaries/) - files listing the time instants (in seconds) of the cycle boundaries for each audio (the two columns are the same, the 2nd is included to make the format acceptable for Audacity)
