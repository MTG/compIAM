    "Relative to other musical styles, Carnatic Music is heavily ornamented. This ornamentation is not superficial decoration but rather is integral to musical meaning [2]. The ornaments, known as gamakas, can greatly alter the sound of the notated svaras (notes); for example, some gamakas do not rest at all on the theoretical pitch of the notated svara, and instead involve oscillations between pitches either side of it [3,4]. This oscillatory movement is particularly characteristic of the style, and can often subsume individual svaras [4]. The surface effect on the melodic line is that it typically has fewer stable pitch regions than many other styles. Such qualities makes it difficult for researchers who are not themselves Carnatic musicians to reliably identify svaras from audio recordings."

Some musicians use the term in a narrower sense to refer to phrases that are particularly characteristic of the rāga, but here we use the term in its broader sense, referring to any melodic segment that is coherent from a Carnatic performer’s perspective. These melodic patterns are the means through which the character of the rāga is expressed and form the basis of various improvisatory and compositional formats in the style [2,9].

Annotations were created in Carnatic notation, known as sargam [36]. As there is no definitive list of sañcāras in a given rāga, the segmentations are based on the annotator’s experience as a professional performer and student of a highly esteemed musical lineage. These annotations are therefore subjective to some degree, but have the benefit of being based on expert performer knowledge rather than on an externally imposed metric that may be irrelevant to musical concepts held by culture bearers."
