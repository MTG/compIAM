# Accessing the Dunya corpora

Built within the framework of the [CompMusic project](https://compmusic.upf.edu/), the Dunya corpora cover several World music traditions and can be accessed through different ways. In compIAM we provide tools to easily access the Carnatic and Hindustani corpora in Dunya.

When initializing the corpora access through compIAM you will be asked to provide an *access token*. To get the *access token* you need to register to the [Dunya web portal](https://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/). Once your registration is validation by the CompMusic team, you can access your user account information where an access token is provided. Use this token to initialize the ``compiam.Corpora`` objects and access the corpora.
